As technology continues to evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an increasingly important tool for product development. It’s no longer a question of whether AI should be used, but how. AI can provide product teams with invaluable insights, allowing them to make better decisions and create better products. But, as with any new technology, there are some misconceptions about AI that must be addressed.

The first misconception is that AI is a threat to product managers and product teams. This simply isn’t true. AI is not meant to replace product managers and product teams, but rather to help them do their jobs better. AI can provide product teams with valuable data and insights, allowing them to make more informed decisions and create better products.

Another misconception is that AI is too complex to implement. This too is not true. AI can be used in a variety of ways, from helping product teams discover customer trends to predicting customer behavior.
